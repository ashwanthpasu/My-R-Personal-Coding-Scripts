# Reshape into new dataset with the results
# This is done using a package called dplyr. Explanation below

# Line 1 takes the dataframe and assigns what will result to a new dataframe called "results"
# The %>% operator means "take df, then do the following"
# Line 2 groups by each unique combination of the four variables specified
# Line 3 and 4 summarizes the number of impressions, total spend, and avg_cpm

# output the file
write.csv(results, "results.csv")

# Notes: summarizing in this way does not create a row in the results unless there is an impression with 
# that specific combination.  Therefore the roughly 3700 rows you have on your results are not listed here.
# On the other hand, your script missed two exchange names, leaving your results 3 impressions short of the 
# total.  They are included here.
